# Transform a JSON Schema to Yup Schema

A utility to generate a Yup Schema from a valid JSON Schema.

json-schema-yup-transform is heavily inspired by [schema-toyup](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/schema-to-yup) but strictly supports the draft 7 [specifications](https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/release-notes.html)

The main objective is to have the draft 7 specification transformed to Yup as much as possible.
