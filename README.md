# Transform a JSON Schema to Yup Schema

A utility to generate a Yup Schema from a valid JSON Schema.

json-schema-yup-transform is heavily inspired by [schema-to-yup](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/schema-to-yup) but strictly supports the draft 7 [specification](https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/release-notes.html)

The main objective is to provide as many of the features of the draft 7 specification generated to Yup as possible.
